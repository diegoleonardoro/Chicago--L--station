<h2> 2. What’s the standard deviation for the Washington/Wabash stop? What’s your hypothesis for why?</h2>

The standard deviation of the Washington/Wabash stop is 3,961. This is a high standard deviation considering that it is around half the daily.
This is a very broad standard deviation, and as we can see in the chart below, most of the data is 1 or 2 standard deviations below the average, suggesting that the Washington/Wabash stop was probably being renovated and had to be shut down during certain times.
